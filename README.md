# File-Format-Separator
This Python script organizes files in a specified input folder into subfolders based on their file formats. It categorizes files into folders such as Photos, Videos, Documents, and RawPhotos, depending on their extensions. Files with unsupported formats are moved to an "OtherFormats" folder for efficient organization.
